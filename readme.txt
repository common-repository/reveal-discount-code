PLEASE link to to my website if you decide to use this plugin, it helps to keep it FREE!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `revealdiscountcode` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place '[rdc_discount_box title="title of the button before click" code="code to be revealed" link="http://www.linkyouwantthemtogotoonclick.com"]' in your pages and posts.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= How to I change the button text and the link? =

Simply modify the 'title' argument in the shortcode for the text before the click. For the revealed text change the 'code' argument. For the affiliate link change the 'link' argument.

= How to I change the button style? =

Currently you'll have to change the CSS file to change the style of the buttons. Hopefully if this plugin is used more we'll create a styles control panel in Wordpress.

You can edit the file located in your plugins directory and then edit '/reveal-discount-code/css/discount-box.css'
